## Hello from the International Space Station! I am an astronaut and I'm going on a mission in space. I will share my experiences here as I journey through the galaxy. I am on a team of 50 astronauts, astrophysicists, engineers and scientists. Our goal is to explore and study the Milky Way Galaxy, eventually making our way to the Galactic Center.
